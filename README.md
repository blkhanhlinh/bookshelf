ðŸ“Œ Naming branch:

There are 2 types of branches:

- Feature: This type of branch is for creating a new feature, and the functions should be well described in your Pull Request. Pattern: `feature/name`

- Fix: Use this type of branch to fix an issue or a set of issues. Pattern: `fix/name`

The branch name will use kebab case: lowercase words and separated by a dash (-). E.g.: feature/example-new-feature
